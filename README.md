# Optimization of Fructose Dehydration reaction to HMF Using Machine Learning
The purpose of this project is building ML models that can predict the rate and the yield of HMF formation from the fructose dehydration reaction. These models can be used for finding:
-	Trends and optimal reaction conditions and catalyst properties. 
-	Better catalysts candidates.
