# Fructose_dehydration_ML_optimization
The purpose of this project is building ML models that can predict the rate and the yield of HMF formation (targets) from the fructose dehydration reaction. These models can be used for finding:
-	Trends and optimal reaction conditions and catalyst properties (optimal features). 
-	Better catalysts.
The prediction of rate constant (k) and the yield are treated as two separate tasks, having two separate datasets and different prediction models.
