# Optimization of Fructose Dehydration reaction to HMF Using Machine Learning
The purpose of this project is building ML models that can predict the rate and the yield of HMF formation from the fructose dehydration reaction. These models can be used for finding:
-	Trends and optimal reaction conditions and catalyst properties. 
-	Better catalysts candidates. 

## File description: 
The "Data_analysis_trends" jupyter notebook shows the code for presenting all the data analysis trends highlighted in this project.   
The "Dataset_with_citations" excel sheet includes all the data used for this project with the citations of the research papers this data was obtained from.   
The "Rate_model" notebook uses the cleaned "Rate_dataset" for building the rate constant model of the fructose dehydration reaction along with making predictions of for the potential catalysts.   
The "Yield_model" notebook uses the cleaned "Yield_dataset" for building the yield model of reaction.
